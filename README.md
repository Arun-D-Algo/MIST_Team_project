# Velare — Open Source E-Commerce Platform  
_A luxury shopping experience, crafted in code._

Velare (Italian for **mist**) is a modern, open-source e-commerce platform built for brands that value design, performance, and polish.  
Originally created for Velare’s own luxury clothing and accessories storefront, this project is now available for developers, designers, and contributors who want to study, customize, or expand a clean front-end commerce implementation.
